        An event planner (also known as a meeting and/or convention planner)
        is someone who coordinates all aspects of professional meetings and
        events. They often choose meeting locations, arrange transportation,
        and coordinate many other details.

        cost<br />
        Solicit bids from places and service providers (for example, florists
        or photographers)<br />
        Work with the client to choose where to hold the event and whom to
        contract for services<br />
        Inspect places to ensure they meet the client's requirements <br />
